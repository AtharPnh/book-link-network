# Book Link Network<br>
An online application to share books, inspired by the “Book Social Network” exercise from the BoualiAli YouTube channel. A full-stack project built using TypeScript, Java, HTML, and CSS.<br>
# Purpose & Overview<br>
This application enables users to create and explore a network of shared book links—browse titles, add recommendations, comment, and connect over what they’re reading. This project is a hands-on implementation of concepts from BoualiAli’s tutorial and serves as a foundation for social features in book-related apps.<br>
# Features (Planned)<br>
* Browse and search shared book entries<br>
* Submit your own book links or recommendations<br>
* Comment on or discuss shared books<br>
* Connect with other users (e.g., follow or like)<br>
Technologies Used<br>
* Frontend: Angular, HTML, CSS<br>
* Backend: Java<br>
